## Introduction

Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework used for building user interfaces. It is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable, meaning it can be easily integrated into existing projects or used to build new ones. Vue.js focuses on the view layer of an application, providing a straightforward way to handle data binding and the composition of components.

## Features

- **Declarative Rendering**: Vue.js uses a template syntax to declaratively render data to the DOM.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Encapsulate UI into reusable components.
- **Directives**: Directives are special tokens in the markup that tell the library to do something to a DOM element.
- **Reactivity**: Automatic change detection ensures the view is always up-to-date.
- **Vue Router**: The official router for Vue.js, enabling navigation between views in a Vue-based Single-Page Application (SPA).
- **Vuex**: State management library for Vue.js applications, ensuring a single source of truth for state management.
